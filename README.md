# Posts API

Not overcomplicated API that helped me to learn things like Express / JWT / GraphQL / MongoDB

# Why I made it 🚀 

I decided, that even if I'm more of a Frontend developer, that should not be an excuse to not learn Backend technologies. This projects main objective was to get me started in 
building APIs using different authorization and authentication methods. The thing that I did not expect was that I would like it so much. Node.js + express is in my opinion realy 
"coding friendly". If you know the basics of Javascript the entry level is realy low and you can pretty much jump straight into it. JWT was more of a challenge as I did not have any previous experience with that topic. But luckly google was PACKED with useful tutorials and articles, that helped me to understand what JWT is and how to use it.
